# 13 Libraries You Should Know as a React Developer

From React Query to Redux... here are the 13 great React libraries which you should know about as a React developer.

[  
](https://cult.honeypot.io/contributors/ashutosh-mishra)Being a modern React developer is not only about understanding the core concepts of React but also about getting well versed with the whole ecosystem of React.

This includes having the knowledge and experience of various React libraries which you can use in your application to make your development process a lot easier.

Even if you don't have the necessary experience working with them, you should at least be aware of their existence and the problem they solve.

So, here are the 13 great React libraries which you should know about as a React developer.

## **1\. React Query**

[React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) is an open source data fetching library in React developed by [Tanner Linsley](https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley). It has more than 1.2 million weekly downloads on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-query) and more than 27k stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query).

React doesn't have an opinionated way to fetch data. This leaves developers free to come up with various data fetching methods. Most of the time, it involves the use of *useEffect* and *useState* hooks or the use of some general purpose state management library.

React Query gives us a standard way to fetch data in React applications and helps us avoid writing complex logic, reduce lines of code, make our code more maintainable, make our application faster, and so on.

It comes with lots of amazing features to make the data fetching and the development experience in React really awesome. These features include *Auto Caching, Auto Refetching, Scroll Recovery, Render-as-you-fetch,* etc. You can look up all the features in the below screenshot.

## **2\. Redux**

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is an open source state management library in JavaScript. It has more than 58K stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux), and more than 7.8 million weekly downloads on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux).

According to Redux's official docs, *Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time travelling debugger. (Source:* [*Redux*](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)*)*

### **Features of Redux**

1. **Predictable** - Helps you write easily testable applications with consistent behaviour across environments.
    
2. **Centralised** - Helps you centralise the state of the application.
    
3. **Debuggable** - It comes up with its own DevTools that make it easy to track the timeline of the application's state.
    
4. **Flexible** - Redux works with any UI layer and has a large ecosystem of addons to fit your needs. (Source: [Redux](https://redux.js.org/))
    

It is one of the most popular state management libraries in React and makes building large scale, industrial applications easier.

## **3\. MUI Core (formerly Material-UI)**

Any list featuring the best React libraries would be incomplete without adding [MUI Core](https://mui.com/). It's a React styling library that helps you build amazing UIs in no time. The MUI Core contains 3 foundational libraries for building and shipping UI faster-
